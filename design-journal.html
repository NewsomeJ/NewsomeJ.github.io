        <p>What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response:I want to do a portolio page for when I'm done with school. I'm not great at coding, it is just not clicking yet.

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>When we design, we are telling a story. We tell it through visuals, through content, and through the paths we lead our viewers on. When we can imagine a viewer to tell our story to, it can make for a stronger design. It helps us focus on crafting our story.
 
         <p> This week’s journal prompt, I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. This user could be you; it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? what are their hobbies, clothes, music, favorite foods, books, tv. what's their personality like. Once you've imagined this person. write about them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it.  </p>
        <p>Response: The one user that will love to use it would be me. I would be able to display projects that I'm proud of. I would be able to give the link to possible clients, as well as showing it to friends and family so they can see what I actually do.</p>

        <h2>Week Four</h2>
        <p>Read this short article https://hbr.org/2019/08/learning-is-supposed-to-feel-uncomfortable and this one on resistance https://www.mindful.org/the-neuroscience-of-resistance-and-how-to-overcome-it/. Considering these articles, make a list of 5 things to keep you going when you feel resistance or discomfort.</p>
        <p>Response:I'm fine with discomfort of learning something new. At my age, I'm proud of myself. However, I have a TBI (tramatic brain injury) and my short-term memory was damaged. Things I've learned through pt:
          <ol>
          <li> Read new information over and over. Sometimes it takes me 2-4 times to actually retain the information.</li>
          <li>Practice the process of something, such as html and css coding, over and over. Repetition is key to retaining skills.</li>
          <li>Be patient with myself. </li>
          <li>Don't procrastinate.</li>
          <li>Be proud of myself.</li>
          </ol>
